# shipdashboard

The goal of shipdashboard is to display a simple shiny app using the [ships data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IeaDpJNqfgUZzGdQmR6cz2H3EQ3_QfCV)

## Database Setup

* If you do not wish to populate the MySQL database and access this app using local data please switch to **local_data** branch which does not require this setup procedure
* Use the **init.sql** file inside the **setup** directory to create the ships database and tables required for this shiny app
* After you create the tables you need to make sure to update the **app_constants.R** file with the database constants like hostname, username and password.
* To populate the database with the ships data run the **populate_ships.R** in the **setup** directory.

## Demo

This app is hosted here: [main branch](https://vedha.tech/shipdashboard), [local_data](https://vedha.tech/ship_dashboard)
